                    <h3>About Mountrails:</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are large numbers of tourism websites facilitating the customers regarding travel and tourism. But usually, their guidance is wrong or difficult to understand. So, our aim to design and develop this website is to provide a tourist guide to facilitate domestic and international tourist. Deciding to travel is the first step towards discovering all that the world hides in its four corners. However, with so many options, it can be difficult to choose one. Needing a break from work is different to having a desire to explore a different culture. <br>Tourism is an important part of the modern service industry and a strategic pillar industry of the global economy. It can provide a large number of employment opportunities and good income with strong action and less resource consumption. Promoting the development of tourism is of great practical significance in changing the mode of economic development, adjusting the industrial structure, and expanding domestic demand. The so-called preference is that consumers like one commodity more than another.<br> It is a subjective description method that can reflect a kind of emotion and tendency in people’s heart. Preferences have individual characteristics and group characteristics. In other words, a certain group with some common characteristics has similarities in theory. Tourists’ preference for tourism destination choice means that some common factors will affect the choice of tourism destination by groups of tourists with specific characteristics. Therefore, there are some similarities in the choice of tourist destinations. That is, they have similar preferences. Tourism destination preference prediction is an important part of tourism research, tourism planning, and management. Therefore, accurate prediction of tourism destination selection preference can improve the scientific level and effectiveness of tourism research planning and management.<br> Tourist destination refers to nonresidential area, which is the place where tourists stay and visit for a short time, also known as a tourist destination or tourist resort. The formation of a tourism destination needs six elements: food, housing, transportation, tourism, shopping, and entertainment. Tourism destination is a specific geographical area managed by a unified destination management organization, which can be a specific scenic spot, or a town, or an area of a country, or the whole country, or even a larger place [13]. The common characteristics of tourist destinations are attraction, comfort, and accessibility, a specific area with certain tourism resources, facilities, and transportation conditions, which can attract a certain number of tourists to carry out tourism activities. Our Mountrails will help these people in finding the beautiful and historical places of Gilgit Baltistan, no doubt the heart of our beloved country Pakistan, according to their interest and attraction. Our website not only provides the information and guidance of beautiful places of Gilgit Baltistan but also guide about the hotels near the places so that a person can easily travel towards the destination with no issue of residence. We will also mention the information of hotel, management system, quality of food, quality of rooms etc. A person can also book the hotel rooms from our website which will be directed to the manager of the hotel. <br>The main problem facing the people is residence especially family persons.<br> So, for sure our website will be fruitful for all of you. In view of the fact that the important characteristics of tourism destination selection preference are not considered in the current prediction methods of tourism destination selection preference, resulting in low prediction accuracy and comprehensive accuracy and long prediction time, a tourism destination selection preference prediction method based on edge calculation is proposed. This website will help to provide modern technology for tourism industry and help to boost the tourism.
